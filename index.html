<p>Certified Hoop Coach.I Custom make Hoops for fitness, dance, parties, events and so much more!
HTII came about through my love and passion of working with people, both children and adults within the special needs field, schools and through the community; showing ways of enhancing our bodies and minds with the use of a hula hoop.</p>


<p>As a certified Hoop Coach through Deanne Love's Hoop Coach program; I custom make hoops for fitness and dance. I?m trained to teach 4,6,& 8 week Hoop Fitness Classes. I really enjoy referring to Hoop Fitness as Movement therapy, as hooping is a mind/body connection.
Book a party, order a hoop, schedule a fitness class.
